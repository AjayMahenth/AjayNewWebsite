I will also be joining the CWRU School of Medicine as an M1 in July 2025. My career interests lie in bio statistics and how we can utilize big data to help inform medicine and public health initiatives.\nDuring my undergraduate at CWRU, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Biology while also competing on the Men’s Varsity Tennis Team. I have had immense research experience in working as a student researcher within University Hospital’s Department of Orthopedics and in the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic’s Lerner Research Institute. I have also worked part-time as a patient transporter at University Hospitals and as a peer tutor in CWRU’s division of student affairs.\nOn this website, you will find a selection of my professional experiences as well as information on my current research projects. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my work as a future public health professional. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."

    "text": "Projects\nThe first major research project I was involved with was as a student researcher in the Department of Orthopedics at University Hospitals. The project aimed to understand the use of retrograde intramedullary nails (rIMNs) in the fixation of pathologic femur fractures, as few studies have investigated the safety and efficacy of rIMN in the fixation of pathologic femur lesions. I was heavily involved with data mining and reviewing surgical records on REDCap to identify those patients that received a retrograde as opposed to an antegrade intramedullary nail. The manuscript on the project has been submitted to various journals and our team is waiting to hear back currently.\nThe second major research project I have been involved with came through my position as a student researcher in the Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences in the Lerner Research Institute. Klotho is a 130-kDa protein encoded by the KL gene that plays a role in the regulation of aging and longevity. Beyond its role in aging, Klotho has become an intriguing target for investigation in heart failure as Klotho deficiency exacerbates cardiac dysfunction and remodeling following cardiac injury. Hence, my project involved using a human soluble α-Klotho Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay Kit to compare human serum Klotho concentrations between patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and healthy controls. The data collection for this project is finished and our team is currently in the final stages of data analysis, preparing a manuscript to send for publication."

    "text": "March 26, 2025\nWhat I Learned from “Moving to a World Beyond p &lt; 0.05”\nWhen I was taught high school statistics, the p-value threshold of 0.05 was treated akin to a sacred line in the sand where results could only possibly be categorized as either significant or not with no in between. Research papers I read in high school would solely base the importance of their results on whether their p-value was &lt;0.05. However, reading this insightful editorial “Moving to a World Beyond p &lt; 0.05,” published in The American Statistician, has truly transformed how I think about statistical inference and even research integrity.\nThe first and most marked takeaway I had from the editorial was the argument that the terminology of “statistically significant” must be abandoned in its entirety. These two words set up the dichotomy between “significant” and “not significant” results that entirely oversimplifies reality and has the potential to mislead both researchers and readers. I had always known there was limitations to using p-values, but the editorial really helped me understand how damaging it can be to rely on arbitrary thresholds for making scientific claims.\nAnother critical point that resonated with me was the call to accept uncertainty. As someone who works closely with noisy biomedical data and hospital records, I feel this idea is much easier said than done. Especially as an undergraduate student, my research supervisors are often expecting hard and fast results from me which makes this idea one that is hard to follow. However, accepting uncertainty must be done to move away from judging all results on p&lt;.05. It is more important to still communicate variability and confidence transparently, rather than hiding behind a false sense of certainty. I have tried to follow this ideal in my research.\nThe final part of this editorial that I enjoyed was the last few sections where the authors collated major points from various other publications about moving past using the p&lt;.05 threshold. Looking at these papers helped give me encouragement that many researchers at the forefront of the scientific community can see that it is time for change and are providing a blueprint for future research to prevent judging all results by arbitrary p value thresholds.\nThis piece has fundamentally altered my views on statistical inference. It’s a call to be thoughtful, open, and modest - three qualities that will make me a better researcher and a more meaningful contributor to scientific knowledge."
